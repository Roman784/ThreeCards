**Zenject**, **R3** and **DOTween** are used as external extensions. 
The game is localized and supports different types of saves.

The goal is to collect cards by triples of similar suits.
The collected cards are placed in the slots. If you fill all the slots, you will lose.
Sometimes you can find bomb cards, you need to drag them into a special slot. If you accidentally press the bomb, it will explode all the cards. 
For collected triples of cards you get chips, which can be spent on tools: shuffle the field, instantly collect a triple or get a new slot.
